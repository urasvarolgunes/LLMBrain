# LLMBrain

The project demonstrates how generative LLMs work behind the scenes. Backend uses Python, Py-Torch, Transformers and Flask to serve an LLM API. Frontend uses JavaScript and React for visuals.
Both services are managed in a Kubernetes cluster, scaled and load balanced to ensure high availability.
